# change_gravity
changing direction of gravity of player in godot 2d

NOTES:

-created small sample level using a tileset found off google

-for the "3d" effect, it's simply the parallax backgrounds layered at different sizes and moving at different relative motions

-the main tilemap is for the actual collisions but it is hidden because the parallax backgrounds are always at the back of every object

CONTROLS:

arrow keys (left, right, up = jump)

wasd keys (change gravity in direction of key)

space bar (punch)

shift (dash)

NEXT STEPS:

-change way gravity changes

-create levels

-possible wall jump

-possible planets with own gravity
