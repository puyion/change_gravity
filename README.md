# change_gravity
changing direction of gravity of player in godot 2d

NOTES:

-created small sample level using a tileset found off google

-for the "3d" effect, it's simply the parallax backgrounds layered at different sizes and moving at different relative motions

-the main tilemap is for the actual collisions but it is hidden because the parallax backgrounds are always at the back of every object

-punching orbs change gravity of player (blue) or enemy (red)

-enemies can hurt player but can be despawned by punching

-added health bar and potions to regenerate health

-player can't die yet

CONTROLS:

left, right = move

up = jump

spacebar = punch

(left or right) + spacebar = punch dash

shift = dash

left or right against wall = wall slide

left or right away from wall = wall jump

NEXT STEPS:

-create levels

-possible slide

-possible planets with own gravity
